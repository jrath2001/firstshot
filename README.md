# FirstShot - ML-based solution for COVID vaccine prioritization

This is our solution to EY Techathon (Problem Statement 2)

In no time from now, vaccine doses will be ready to ship to places across the country. At a time when millions are willing to get vaccinated, we try to deal with the big issue of deciding priority as we answer the question "Who gets the first shot ?"

An unsupervised model divides the districts of India into 5 clusters. A ranking of districts is made (based on COVID mortality rate) for validation and for deciding exact priority. We focus on Phase 2 of vaccine delivery (i.e. for Senior Citizens). 
For Phase 3 (i.e. for younger people with co-morbidities) we propose a classification model that predicts chance of being affected by the virus on an individual level and thus the priority of getting vaccinated.
